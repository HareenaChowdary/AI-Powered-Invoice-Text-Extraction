# AI-Powered Invoice Text Extraction

## üìå Overview
AI-Powered Invoice Text Extraction is an advanced machine learning-based invoice processing tool powered by Azure Form Recognizer and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It automates data extraction from invoices, improving accuracy and efficiency for financial document management.

## üéØ Objective
The aim of this project is to develop a system capable of automatically extracting key information from invoices to streamline the data entry process.

### Key Objectives:
- **Automated Data Extraction**: Accurately extract essential information such as vendor details, invoice dates, total amounts, and item descriptions.
- **Label Prediction**: Train machine learning models to predict predefined labels/features from extracted text, including vendor names, invoice IDs, due dates, and more.
- **Accuracy and Efficiency**: Ensure high accuracy and efficiency in the extraction process to minimize errors and reduce manual effort.
- **Scalability**: Build a scalable solution capable of handling large volumes of invoices across various formats and layouts.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate the system with existing workflows and accounting tools.

## üöÄ Features
- Extracts structured invoice data (Vendor, Customer, Invoice ID, Amount, Dates, etc.).
- Utilizes Azure AI for high-accuracy OCR and form recognition.
- Implements **KNN-based OCR** and **Bidirectional LSTMs** for text recognition and contextual understanding.
- Processes invoices efficiently and exports structured data.
- Saves extracted data in a secure Azure Blob Storage location.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
### OCR System (KNN Algorithm)
- Uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm trained on the MNIST dataset.
- Extracts text from invoice images with confidence scores and line numbers.

### Deep Learning with Bidirectional LSTM
- Captures contextual information from both past and future tokens.
- Enhances sequence labeling and text classification.
- Uses a softmax output layer for probability-based label confidence.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Azure AI Form Recognizer** for document analysis.
- **Python** for processing and automation.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **PySpark** and **Databricks** for large-scale data handling.
- **Bidirectional LSTMs** for deep learning-based text extraction.
- **Azure Blob Storage** for cloud storage.
